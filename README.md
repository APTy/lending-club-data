### Lending Club Data Visualization

Lending Club is the world's largest marketplace connecting investors and borrowers. Not only do they provide their current investment data to developers, but they also maintain a rich, open history of all assets that have ever been processed through their platform. This project allows users to visualize that data in a meaningful way.
